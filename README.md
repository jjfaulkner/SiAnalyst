# chablis

`chablis` is a package for charactisation of Raman spectra of lithiated Si nanoparticles (pending a revelation on the acronym).
It's a little bit of code for fitting the spectral peaks associated with crystalline and amorphous signals --- the fraction of amorphous material is thus determined.
Additionally, an implementation of the RCF model for phonon confinement is incorporated, which enables the particle size distribution to be estimated.
